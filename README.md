# 🐝 Bumblebee – Human-Like Mouse & Keyboard Controller  
**Under Development** 🚧  

Bumblebee is an AI-powered Python package that enables **realistic, human-like control** of the mouse and keyboard. Unlike traditional automation tools, Bumblebee predicts **natural movement patterns** using deep learning, making automated interactions feel organic and smooth.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Cursor Movement** – Uses an RNN with LSTM to generate smooth, human-like paths.  
✅ **Smart Keystroke Simulation** – Factors in key distances, punctuation, and natural typing behavior.  
✅ **25K+ Self-Collected Dataset** – Trained on real human movement data.  
✅ **Upcoming: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Enhancements** – Will further refine movement realism.  
✅ **Uses PyAutoGUI** – Leverages PyAutoGUI for actual mouse and keyboard input simulation.  
✅ **Built with PyTorch** – AI models are developed using PyTorch for deep learning.

## 🚀 How It Works  

### 🖱️ Cursor Movement  
The **cursor path** is determined by a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM layer** on top. It was trained on **30,000 real cursor movements** (self-collected due to the lack of existing datasets). This allows Bumblebee to generate **smooth, human-like paths** instead of robotic jumps.  

🔜 **Coming Soon:**  
To further enhance realism, an **RNN-LSTM + Reinforcement Learning (RL) model** will be integrated, allowing the cursor to learn and adapt to different movement styles dynamically.  

### ⌨️ Keyboard Control  
The keyboard controller is based on a **set of mathematical rules** and factors such as:  
- Distance between keys  
- Typing speed variations  
- Punctuation handling  
- Natural key press delays  

These elements make typing behavior appear **more organic and less predictable**, replicating human keystroke patterns.  

### 🏗️ Under the Hood  
- **Mouse & Keyboard Simulation:** Bumblebee uses **PyAutoGUI** to simulate real input events.  
- **AI Model:** Built using **PyTorch**, leveraging deep learning for movement prediction.
